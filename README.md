## Future Plans
After graduating from the University of Iowa in May of 2023, I will be spending my summer traveling and working in Iowa City. Starting in August, I will move to Denver, Colorado to work as a full time Business Analytics Consultant for Plante Moran. I am excited to explore a new city and career after graduation, and I am thankful for all of the opportunities I have gained from the University of Iowa.
